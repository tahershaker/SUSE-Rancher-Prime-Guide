# Learn About SUSE Rancher Prime Fleet

Welcome to the `SUSE® Rancher Prime Fleet` section — your guide to understanding the continuous delivery and GitOps engine included in the `SUSE Rancher Prime` Suite. `SUSE® Rancher Prime Fleet` is built to help you manage Kubernetes at scale — giving you the ability to deploy applications and configurations across dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of clusters in a consistent, version-controlled, and automated way.

In this guide, you’ll get a clear understanding of what `SUSE® Rancher Prime Fleet` is, what it’s designed to do, and how it fits into GitOps workflows within `SUSE® Rancher Prime`. We’ll walk through the core use cases, key features, high-level architecture, and how it integrates with the rest of the suite to simplify lifecycle management.
