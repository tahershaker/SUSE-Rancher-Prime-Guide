# Learn About SUSE Rancher ClusterAPI

Welcome to the `SUSE® Rancher Prime – ClusterAPI` section — your guide to understanding how `SUSE` integrates ClusterAPI (CAPI) into the `SUSE Rancher Prime` Suite. Also known as Turtles project, this solution brings powerful, declarative Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management into `SUSE Rancher Prime` — helping you provision, scale, and manage clusters across different infrastructures using consistent, GitOps-style workflows.

In this guide, you’ll get a clear overview of what `SUSE Rancher Prime ClusterAPI` is, why it matters, and how it extends the capabilities of `SUSE Rancher Prime` with infrastructure automation. We’ll walk through the core concepts, use cases, high-level architecture, and how it fits with the rest of the suite.

> **Note:** `SUSE Rancher Prime – ClusterAPI` (codenamed Turtles) is `SUSE’s` enterprise integration of the CNCF Cluster API project. In this guide, we’ll refer to it as `Rancher ClusterAPI` to keep things simple, but know that we’re referring specifically to the Rancher-native implementation within the `SUSE Rancher Prime` Suite.
