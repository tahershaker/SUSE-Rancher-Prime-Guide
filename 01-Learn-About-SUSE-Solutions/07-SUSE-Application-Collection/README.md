# Learn About SUSE Observability

Welcome to the `SUSE® Application Collection` section — your guide to understanding the curated set of applications included in the `SUSE Rancher Prime` Suite. This solution is designed to accelerate Kubernetes adoption by providing a collection of pre-packaged, validated, and production-ready applications — all deployable directly through Rancher.

In this guide, you’ll get familiar with what the `SUSE Application Collection` is, how it simplifies day-one Kubernetes workloads, and how it helps teams move faster with less complexity. We’ll walk through key features, common use cases, available app categories, and how the collection integrates into your Rancher-managed environments.
