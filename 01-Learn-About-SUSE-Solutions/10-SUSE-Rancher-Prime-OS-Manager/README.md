> **Note:** `SUSE Rancher Prime – OS Manager` is the commercial edition of the open-source Elemental project. In this guide, we refer to it by its enterprise name as part of the `SUSE Rancher Prime` Suite. The focus is specifically on managing the operating system layer, not full Kubernetes nodes. Throughout this guide, we’ll refer to it simply as `OS Manager` for clarity and simplicity.
